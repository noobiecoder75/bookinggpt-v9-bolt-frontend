# Netlify redirects for SPA client-side routing
# This ensures all routes are handled by the React app
# Note: API routes are handled by netlify.toml which takes precedence

# Client portal routes
/client/* /index.html 200

# All other routes (fallback for SPA)
# This catches non-API routes and serves the React app
/* /index.html 200
